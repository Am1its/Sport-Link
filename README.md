# SportLink - Find Your Match. Play Your Game.

[cite_start]**SportLink** is a social platform designed to help people find sports partners in real-time[cite: 354, 356]. [cite_start]Our mission is to transform fragmented sports communities (currently scattered across Facebook and WhatsApp) into a single, efficient, and location-based ecosystem[cite: 358, 360, 367].

## 🚀 The Vision (Think Big)
[cite_start]To enable anyone to find sports partners easily, without relying on their existing social circle[cite: 406, 407]. [cite_start]We aim for SportLink to be the essential app for anyone moving to a new city looking to build their athletic community[cite: 408].

## 🎯 MVP Scope (Start Small)
For the current development phase (ending September 2026), we are focusing on:
* [cite_start]**Core Value**: Finding people to play with, easily and quickly[cite: 420].
* [cite_start]**Features**: Create/Join nearby games, filter by time/location/skill level, and real-time connection[cite: 411, 412, 413, 414].
* [cite_start]**Target**: Single city deployment with a limited number of sports to validate user engagement[cite: 410, 415].

## 🛠️ Technical Feasibility & Stack
[cite_start]Our project relies on proven location-based technologies[cite: 422]:
* **Frontend**: React Native (Targeting Mobile)
* **Backend**: Node.js
* **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
* **External APIs**: Google Maps Platform (Places & Maps JavaScript API)

## 🧪 Technical Validation (Phase 1)
[cite_start]We have successfully validated the core technical requirement: fetching real-time athletic facility data[cite: 421].
* **Challenge**: Initial tests with the `stadium` type returned `ZERO_RESULTS`.
* **Solution**: Pivoted to `keyword` and `field` searches, successfully identifying local hubs like **Sportek Tel Aviv** and **"New" Sport Centre**.
* **Status**: **OK** - API communication and location data retrieval are fully functional.
